The IPoDWDM-driven network consolidation removes the demarcation between packet and optical layers, clearly increasing management system
complexity, but also creating new opportunities. We propose TCP/IPoDWDM as
a means to advance this consolidation, taking into account how physical layer
impairments affect throughput and fairness depending on the TCP congestion
control algorithm in use. This study is the first to explore dynamic congestion
control algorithm adaptation at the server or virtual machine level as a potential solution for loss-sensitive applications, such as Data-Intensive Science
(DiS). By leveraging Optical Signal-to-Noise Ratio (OSNR) metrics provided
by integrated control and management planes, this approach aims to optimize
performance during the session establishment phase. We outline the modeling
approach, experiments conducted, and directions for future research.
